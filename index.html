  <p>The relationships between digital media use and mental health have been
     investigated since the mid-1990s, but the delineation between beneficial
     and pathological use of digital media has not been established, and there
      are no widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Some experts consider overuse
       a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders, but moderate
       digital media use has been found beneficial to mental health.
